- Click on a highlighted hole to move a hole to that spot.
- If your move is a hop, you have an option to continue your turn by moving your selected piece further along.
- When you are done, click the gray arrow in the bottom right corner to end your turn.
- To advance a CPUs turn, simply click anywhere on the screen.
- Yes, you can pit a CPU against another CPU. I pray you do not.
